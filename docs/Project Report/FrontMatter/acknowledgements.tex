\section*{\centering Acknowledgements}


I am grateful to Fred, my supervisor for coming up with the initial idea for the project and guiding me through the process. Also Neil the module coordinator for providing a extra extension to the deadline on top of the 10 day extension due to COVID-19 and it's related stresses.

I'd like to thank my parents for putting up with me when I returned home from University due to the COVID-19 outbreak, and my partner Laurie for trying their hardest to keep me on track with work, even though they were stuck in another household during the lockdown. I'd also like to mention my friends Sam and Bethan for their motivation to get me working.
