\begin{comment}
    This section should discuss your preparation for the project, including background reading, your analysis of the problem and the process or method you have followed to help structure your work.  It is likely that you will reuse part of your outline project specification, but at the end of the project you should have more to discuss. 

    \textbf{Note}: 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item All of the sections and text in this example are for illustration purposes. The main Chapters are a good starting point, but the content and actual sections that you include are likely to be different.
   
        \item  Look at the document MMP\_S08 Project Report and Technical Work \cite{ProjectReportTechicalWork} for additional guidance.

Initial brief:

\begin{quote}
Research projects in collaboration with biologists and farmers look at automatically detecting sheep from aerial imagery, in particular multi-spectral images. This can also applied to other animals such as deer. This project looks into using these images to detect and count sheep. A variety of methods can be explored.

The aim of this project is to investigate ways to locate and count the sheep in a set of aerial images of fields, some of which were taken on a red-edge camera to provide multi spectral images. At the start we will mainly look at white sheep, but sheep are not just white so we must investigate ways of identifying black and brown sheep also. I will also discuss how the techniques could be used to count and track other mammals such as deer. The purpose of identifying the animals from the aerial images is that it allows biologists to observe them without disturbing them such as attaching GPS trackers to them individually. The images were originally used by biologists to identify and track the flora but using the same data to track fauna would also advantageous.

\end{figure}

Locating and counting the sheep can obviously be done manually as seen in figure \ref{fig:manual} but this would be tedious and time consuming as the images can be very large and the sheep few and far between with each sheep only covering around 20 pixels in size. As the images are at a resolution of approximately 8 cm per pixel if the camera is  120m above the landscape.\cite{rededge}

this is the first method, I found some existing research about it....
This is the good things about the first method...
This is the bad things about the first method....
on the whole the first method would be useful in this scenario..

This is the bad things about the third  method....
on the whole the third method would be useful in this scenario..

This method would be the most superior method to use in comparison to the other methods because....I hope to investigate applying this to the project and proving/disproving my ideas....

\section{Analysis}
%TC:ignore
\begin{comment}
Taking into account the problem and what you learned from the background work, what was your analysis of the problem? How did your analysis help to decompose the problem into the main tasks that you would undertake? Were there alternative approaches? Why did you choose one approach compared to the alternatives? 

There should be a clear statement of the research questions, which you will evaluate at the end of the work. 

In most cases, the agreed objectives or requirements will be the result of a compromise between what would ideally have been produced and what was felt to be possible in the time available. A discussion of the process of arriving at the final list is usually appropriate.

\subsection{Input: images}

\subsubsection{Standard RGB images}

Some of the digital images used in this project are stored as PNG and JPG, these images will usually contain 3 layers of pixels: one for each Red, Green and Blue. Each pixel contains a brightness value for it's colour, normally between 0 and 255 for an 8-bit image. They are stored in a 3 dimensional array, with the first dimension being which layer of the image 0:red, 1:green and 2:blue then the next dimension is the y axis of the image and finally the x axis of the image, an example shape of an image could be: [3,500,400].

\subsubsection{Red-edge Camera images}
    
The other primary format used in this project are stored as geoTIFF files. These contain a set of metadata, such as a scale and GPS coordinates of the image, and a 2 dimensional array for the y and x axis of the image. In the array there is a set of colour samples, the number of samples can vary. In this case the project is using images from a RedEdge camera so we get 5 samples at each location. Each sample contains 12-bits of data, the first 3 samples being the standard blue, green, red, the remaining two are red edge and near-IR. This gives us extra data to work with.


Colour bands of a rededge camera:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue 
    
    475 nm center, 20 nm bandwidth
    
    \item Green 
    
    560 nm center, 20 nm bandwidth
    
    \item Red 
    
    668 nm center, 10 nm bandwidth
    
    \item rededge
    
    717 nm center, 10 nm bandwidth
    
    \item near-IR
    
    840 nm center, 40 nm bandwidth\cite{rededge}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Opening and managing images}

opencv only designed to handle standard RGB images so we need something else to handle the geoTIFF files.

An initial trial with PyLibTiff \cite{pylibtiff} which is wrapper for the libtiff library to Python using ctypes, resulted in issues with being able to read the geo tags in the files, and saving and transferring the data to the processed files.

Settled on using tifffle.py \cite{tifffle} as it was much simpler to use and had all the features I needed.

\subsection{Processing}

opencv pros and cons, limitations
languages? python quick and easy scripting, 


\subsection{Output: Displaying results}

powerful graphing with matplotlib flexible.



\section{Research Method and Software Process}
%TC:ignore
\begin{comment}
You need to describe briefly the life cycle model or research method that you used. You do not need to write about all of the different process models that you are aware of. Focus on the process model or research method that you have used. It is possible that you needed to adapt an existing method to suit your project; clearly identify what you used and how you adapted it for your needs.

For the research-oriented projects, there needs to be a suitable process for the construction of the software elements that support your work.
